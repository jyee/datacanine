Hi,

I'm Jason. I work as a technical writer and evangelist at ~~Datacanine~~ [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com).

This microsite was inspired by a Russian site that steals content and reposts it (they make money via ads). The site appeared to have run an English -> Russian -> English filter. So Datacanine became a fun translation thing.
